## Business Requirements

### Problem Definition

Even if analysts have reasonably clean data -- 
it's expensive to reach a baseline predictive model. 
"Reasonably clean" doesn't usually mean, model-ready.
For model-ready data, a _feature transform pipeline_ needs 
built and applied to initial data. 
The pipeline build costs time and complexity (technical debt). 
Too often, a similar cost is paid project-to-project. 

There's significant opportunity for pipeline code reuse, project-to-project. 
There's significant opportunity to standardize and de-couple components:
(a) transforms workflow from (b) project-specific configuration. 
That de-coupled system should drag-and-drop to each project.
Within one project, several models co-exist via standard config files.

Data Science (DS) code tends more _ad hoc_ versus software engineers' work.
Part of the explanation is product development 101: given uncertain direction,
the builder rapidly prototypes, wary of wasting effort on dead ends.
Another partial explanation: practitioners may train in subject matter domains 
(economics, biology, mathematics, physics), more than engineering principles.

But in 2024, ad hoc workflows severely reduce DS' potential impact.
Democratized cloud computing allows DS to _ascend the value chain_ -- 
to actually deploy workflows (products), not just research and develop. 
From experience, ad hoc workflows are painful to deploy and maintain. 
Software engineering best practices deliver the antidote.
Those best practices should target workflow segments common across DS analyses.


### Objectives

Big picture goals (qualitative statements)

### Metrics (Key Results)

Measurements to gauge progress toward Objectives.

### Vision Statement

What will customers' lives look like when this problem is solved?

### Risks

Business value, usability, feasibility/implementation, ...


## Scope and Limitations

### Major Benefits to Customers

Probably a list. Prefer to frame customer benefits versus "features",
which may or may not deliver customer value.

### Limitations and Exclusions

What _won't_ this product deliver, which customers may be thinking about?


## Business Context

### Stakeholder Profiles

Who are these folks, and what do they care about? Their incentives?

### Project Priorities

How will the project balance core dimensions: 
schedule, features, quality, staff, cost?
What are the baseline expectations, constraints, 
and pockets of flexibility (degrees of freedom)?

### Deployment Considerations

How will users interact with this solution? 
To satisfy that expectation, how must this product be deployed?
