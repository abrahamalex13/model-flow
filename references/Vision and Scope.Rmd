## Business Requirements

### Problem Definition

For data practitioners and business managers,
there's massive, avoidable waste when formulating predictive models.

- Coders and business managers waste time (dollars) 
misaligned on, or tracking down, critical details. 
  - "What data observations are we including/excluding?"
  - "Which model features are we including/excluding?"
  - "What transformation functions are treating the model features?" 
  - "In this ensemble, what models are included, and what are their details?"
  - "Where in the code is _____ implemented?"

- Coders waste time (dollars) re-building _transform pipelines_
project-to-project. Technical debt compounds with unnecessary idiosyncrasies. 

There's significant opportunity for pipeline code reuse, project-to-project. 
There's significant opportunity to standardize and de-couple components:
(a) transforms workflow from (b) project-specific configuration. 

In 2024, ad hoc Data Science (DS) workflows severely reduce potential impact.
"What got you here won't get you there." 
Democratized cloud computing allows DS to _ascend the value chain_: 
to actually deploy workflows (products), not just research and develop. 
Ad hoc workflows are expensive to deploy and maintain. 

DS code has tended more _ad hoc_ than classic software engineering. 
Part of the explanation is product development 101: given uncertain direction,
builders rapidly prototype, wary of wasting effort on dead ends.
Another partial explanation: practitioners may train in subject matter domains 
(economics, biology, mathematics, physics), more than engineering principles.

### Objectives

- 

### Metrics (Key Results)

Measurements to gauge progress toward Objectives.

### Vision Statement

What will customers' lives look like when this problem is solved?

### Risks

Business value, usability, feasibility/implementation, ...


## Scope and Limitations

### Major Benefits to Customers

Probably a list. Prefer to frame customer benefits versus "features",
which may or may not deliver customer value.

### Limitations and Exclusions

What _won't_ this product deliver, which customers may be thinking about?


## Business Context

### Stakeholder Profiles

Who are these folks, and what do they care about? Their incentives?

### Project Priorities

How will the project balance core dimensions: 
schedule, features, quality, staff, cost?
What are the baseline expectations, constraints, 
and pockets of flexibility (degrees of freedom)?

### Deployment Considerations

How will users interact with this solution? 
To satisfy that expectation, how must this product be deployed?
